README

This library, libicmp, is a very simple interface for sending and receiving ICMP
datagrams.  It currently only supports IPv4, so any patches for adding support
fro IPv6 (see TODO) are most welcome!  Also welcome are patches for improved 
error handling and refactoring of error codes.

Libicmp was initally developed by Tim Lawless and later refactored and extended upon
by Joachim Nilsson.
